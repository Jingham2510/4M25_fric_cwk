TODO LIST - CROSS/TICK OFF WHEN DONE 

1) Create basic PyBullet file (can be empty) - DONE
2) Create/Add URDF of IRB6400 robot (with modelled end-effector)
3) Implement motion control of robot 
4) Implement friction and normal force plane 
4a) Implement uniform plane (friction and normal force the same over the entire thing)
4b) Implement non-uniform plane (friction/normal force change depending on XY position)
5) Complete validity test (i.e. run multiple times through same "k" value - show there the same)
6) Sweep through k/mu values, plot against avg force experienced (can do a 3d plot showing how the forces change)
7)Implement predictive controller
7a) Expand when points are known better.
