TODO LIST - CROSS/TICK OFF WHEN DONE 

1) Create basic PyBullet file (DONE)
2) Create/Add URDF of IRB6400 robot (with modelled end-effector) (DONE)
2)a) fix intertial of robot (DONE)
3) Implement motion control of robot (Done)
 3a) Fine tune rotation allowances (Done)
 3b) Fine tune max forces 
 3c) Add end-effector to URDF (done)
 3d) fine tune URDF -joints etc
4) Implement friction and normal force plane 
4a) Implement uniform plane (friction and normal force the same over the entire thing)
4b) Implement non-uniform plane (friction/normal force change depending on XY position)
5) Complete validity test (i.e. run multiple times through same "k" value - show there the same)
6) Sweep through k/mu values, plot against avg force experienced (can do a 3d plot showing how the forces change)
7)Implement predictive controller
7a) Expand when points are known better.
